# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Economics and Business Analytics**, building expertise at the intersection of economic theory and modern data science. This repository showcases my journey through **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to apply cutting-edge analytical tools to economic problems.

## 🎓 About This Portfolio

This portfolio documents my coursework and projects as I develop skills in **causal inference** and **predictive analytics**. The course follows a "Concept Extension" philosophy: we start with foundational statistical concepts—like ordinary least squares regression—and extend them using machine learning algorithms—like Lasso and Ridge regression. This approach helps bridge traditional econometric methods with modern computational techniques.

My goal is to demonstrate how economic theory can be enhanced with data science tools to generate actionable insights. Whether it's understanding policy impacts through causal modeling or forecasting economic trends with machine learning, I'm learning to combine the rigor of economics with the power of modern analytics.
